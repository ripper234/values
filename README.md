This document is the best textual representation I have for my personal Core Values.
It may not be 100% clear, consistent or intelligable and is certainly far from complete ... but Perfect is the enemy of Good.

**Pull requests welcome!**

Mission Statement
=================
I am here in this world to have fun, to save the world, and to save myself.
I am here to love and be loved.
I am here to learn and to teach.
I am here.

Core Values
===========
The primary purpose of this core value document is to capture and communicate the reason for my existence.
A secondary purpose is to act as (one of many) channels for receiving input. If you are reading this document, and find a "flaw" or a way this document can be improved, please open an issue or file a pull request.

These values can be treated like [Asimov's laws of robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). Each value is upheld except when it contradicts with a previous value. These values are principles, not absolute promises, and I will abide by them ... until the time comes where I will elect to change them.

1. **Do good** - There is no agreed upon definition of "doing good" so this must be left for individual interpertation. One can say this value is vague or meaningless, but it has personal meaning to me.
2. **Selfishness** - I am here to make myself happy, first and foremost. I will seek not to hurt myself and my happiness in order to please other people.
3. **Fearlessness** - I realize that [Fear is the mind killer](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2-i-must-not-fear-fear-is-the-mind-killer-fear-is), and I strive to make decisions not from a place of fear, but rather from understanding.
4. **[Radical Honesty](http://www.radicalhonesty.com/)** - I plan to never lie (except to protect value #1).
5. **Empathy and Kindness** - I will seek to understand and empathize with different views even and especially when I disagree with them. I will seek to minimize the harm caused to others and maximize their happiness.
7. **Freedom** - I will seek to maximize the freedom and rights enjoyed by any individual or group.
8. **Transparency** - I will seek to voluntarily share the maximal amount of information I can to my loved ones, friends, family and the public.
9. **Dedication** - Do. Or do not. [There is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No).
10. **Peacefullness** - I will try to communicate in a way that allows other people to be honest, critical, questioning and supportive around me and with me. I will seek not to judge or condemn anyone for anything. There is no good or evil in the world, only love and fear.
